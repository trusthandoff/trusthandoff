# TrustHandoff

TrustHandoff is a lightweight protocol and SDK for **verifiable task delegation between AI agents**.

It defines a canonical structure for transferring tasks between agents with:

- agent identity
- cryptographic signatures
- bounded execution permissions
- delegation chains
- verifiable decision logic

TrustHandoff acts as a **delegation trust layer** for multi-agent systems.

# Why TrustHandoff exists

Modern agent frameworks solve orchestration and communication.

They do not solve **verifiable delegation**.

| Layer | Example |
|------|------|
| Agent ↔ tools | MCP |
| Agent ↔ communication | A2A |
| Agent orchestration | LangGraph / CrewAI / AutoGen |
| **Agent delegation trust** | TrustHandoff |

TrustHandoff introduces a portable delegation primitive:

```
SignedTaskPacket
```

This packet allows agents to safely hand off tasks while preserving:

- authority
- permissions
- provenance
- cryptographic verification

# Installation

```
pip install trusthandoff
```

---

# Quickstart

Minimal example:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
from trusthandoff import (
    AgentIdentity,
    Permissions,
    SignedTaskPacket,
    sign_packet,
    verify_packet,
    process_handoff
)

planner = AgentIdentity.generate()
research = AgentIdentity.generate()

packet = SignedTaskPacket(
    packet_id="pk_example",
    task_id="task_example",
    from_agent=planner.agent_id,
    to_agent=research.agent_id,
    issued_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
    expires_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc) + timedelta(minutes=10),
    nonce="nonce-example",
    intent="Research company background",
    context={"company": "Example Corp"},
    permissions=Permissions(
        allowed_actions=["read", "search"],
        max_tool_calls=5
    ),
    signature_algo="Ed25519",
    signature="",
    public_key=planner.public_key_pem
)

signed_packet = sign_packet(packet, planner)

verify_packet(signed_packet)

decision = process_handoff(signed_packet)

print(decision.decision)
print(decision.reason)
```

Expected output:

```
ACCEPT
Packet verified and valid
```

# Core primitives

TrustHandoff revolves around four primitives:

```
SignedTaskPacket
DelegationEnvelope
DelegationChain
PacketDecision
```

These primitives allow verifiable multi-hop delegation between agents.

---

# Framework adapters

TrustHandoff provides adapters for major agent frameworks.

Current adapters:

- CrewAI
- AutoGen
- LangGraph

These adapters map framework-native delegation events into TrustHandoff primitives.

See:

```
specs/adapters.md

# Vision

TrustHandoff aims to become the **trust layer for delegation in multi-agent systems**.

Rather than replacing agent frameworks, TrustHandoff complements them by providing a secure delegation primitive.
